# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic arcade game allows you to control a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each meal. Be careful not to collide with the walls or yourself!

## How to Play

### Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Move the snake up
- **Down Arrow**: Move the snake down
- **Left Arrow**: Move the snake left
- **Right Arrow**: Move the snake right

### Objective

- Eat the red food squares to grow your snake.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail, as it will result in game over.
