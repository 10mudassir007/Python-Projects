Pomodoro Timer
This Python script provides a simple Pomodoro timer to help you manage your work or study sessions effectively. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages focused work periods followed by short breaks. This script allows you to specify a task and the duration of your work session in hours, minutes, and seconds.

How to Use
Run the script in a Python environment.

You will be prompted to enter the task you want to work on.

Next, enter the duration of your work session in hours, minutes, and seconds.

The timer will start, and you'll see the time remaining for your work session.

During the work session, you'll receive a short break (5 minutes) after every 25 minutes of work. After four work sessions, you'll get a longer break (20 minutes).

Once the timer runs out, you'll be prompted to enter a new task and duration to continue working.

To exit the script, simply close the terminal or interrupt it using Ctrl+C.
