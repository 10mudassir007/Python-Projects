A file organizer is a software application designed to streamline the management of your files. It achieves this by actively monitoring a designated source path, typically a folder, in a continuous loop. When a file emerges in this source location, the program promptly relocates it to a specified destination path based on the file's extension.

Moreover, if the file being moved to the destination folder already exists there, the program takes care of the redundancy issue by automatically deleting the redundant file.

NOTE: if testing with local computer, makes sure to have to have "r" before the paths specified. 
E.g  r"C:\Users\Precious pc\Downloads"
